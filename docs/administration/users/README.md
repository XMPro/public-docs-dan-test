# Users

A User is an XMPro account shared between all XMPro Products available in the Subscription Manager. Your User's Subscriptions, Rights, and Roles determine what Products you can access, as well as what you are allowed to view and edit within the Products. A Company's Administrator can assign Subscriptions for Products to specific Users within the Company.&#x20;
