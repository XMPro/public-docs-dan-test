# Azure Data Explorer

<img src="../../../../../.gitbook/assets/Azure Data Explorer Icon.png" alt="" data-size="line"> The Azure Data Explorer Connector allows you to connect to an Azure Data Explorer instance and retrieve data as requested by the Application.

The Azure Data Explorer platform is a fully managed, high-performance, big data analytics platform that makes it easy to analyze high volumes of data in near real-time.&#x20;

Please see their [store page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/data-explorer/) and [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/) for more information about the Azure Data Explorer platform.&#x20;

Read on for an [example](examples.md),[ ](broken-reference)its [configuration](configuration.md), and [release notes](./#connector-release-notes).

## Live Updates

This Connector supports Live Updates, i.e. it can update the entity to display the most up-to-date information.&#x20;

This capability is available when the Connector is configured for time series data (See [Is Time Series](broken-reference)) and polling (See [Enable Polling](broken-reference)).

## Pre-requisites

The user must have credentials to an Azure subscription with permission to read Azure Data Explorer instances.
