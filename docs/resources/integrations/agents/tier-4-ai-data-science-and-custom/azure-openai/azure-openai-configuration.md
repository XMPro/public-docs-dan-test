**Key Credential**

A valid key for the Azure OpenAI instance.

**Deployment Name**

The Deployment Name of a deployed model. The [Endpoint](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MZASoMaVZCmWsNG58Xo/s/27cqp1fhoqA23mCVDSQw/how-to-use/configuration/\~/files#endpoint) and [Key Credential](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MZASoMaVZCmWsNG58Xo/s/27cqp1fhoqA23mCVDSQw/how-to-use/configuration/\~/files#key-credential) can be found in the Keys and Endpoint menu on the Azure Portal page.

### Message Properties <a href="#message-properties" id="message-properties"></a>

The Messages list contains the messages sent to the OpenAI model. The response is generated once every message has been sent, allowing you to split a command into separate messages.

**Description**

A unique, friendly name to describe the message that appears in the message list.

**Order**

Adjust this automatically generated value to rearrange the order in which the messages are sent.

**Type**

The options for the message originator are:

* Assistant: messages that establish a history of the AI's responses for it to draw from.
* System: messages that inform the AI of its role.
* User: messages that prompt a response.

Read [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/advanced-prompt-engineering?pivots=programming-language-chat-completions#system-message) for more on prompt engineering.

**Message**

The message to send. Insert columns from the input payload by enclosing them in double curly braces. For instance, to insert the value of the property ReadingNo, use the text "\{{ReadingNo\}}".
